<h2 align="center"> Effortlessly track employee work hours with a reliable detection system. </h2>

## Description

This is a Work Hour Calculator for employees who work on their laptops, using the laptop camera for detection. The system utilizes a combination of OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow for developing the detection model, aiming to track employees' working hours efficiently.

#### Tech Stack:
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow
- CSV for logging activities

## Getting Started

- Start by cloning the repository into your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0shazil0/work-hour-calculator.git
```

- Next, install all the necessary modules and dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Some modules might be missing, which could result in an error.
- Ensure you have the required models and files:
- - Download the MobileNet-SSD model files deploy.prototxt and mobilenet_iter_73000.caffemodel.
- Have your TensorFlow model actions_w_w_3.h5 ready. (You can create the model according to your own actions by running the Training.ipynb file or You can use the provided model "actions_w_w_3.h5")
- Once you have the setup ready, run the main script:
